    "text": "Overview\nThe exchange of water and carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and the land is akin to earth’s terrestrial ecosystems breathing rate and lung capacity. One of the best ways to monitor changes in the amount of carbon and water in an ecosystem is the eddy-covariance method. This method observes the net amount of carbon and water entering and exiting ecosystems at half-hourly timesteps, which is important because it can provide information on ecosystem processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, and transpiration, their sensitivities to ongoing climate and land use change, and greenhouse gas budgets for carbon accounting and natural climate solutions. Forecasts of carbon uptake and release along with water use can provide insights into the future production of food, fiber, timber, and carbon credits. Additionally, forecasts will highlight the influence that stress and disturbance have on carbon and water cycling."

    "text": "Data: Targets\nThe challenge uses the following TERN data products:\nhttps://portal.tern.org.au/results?topicTerm=flux\nA file with previously released TERN data that has been processed into “targets” is provided below. The same processing will be applied to new data that are used for forecast evaluation.\n\nNet ecosystem exchange\nDefinition\nNet ecosystem exchange (NEE) is the net movement of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to the ecosystem. At the 30-minute time resolution it is reported as \\(\\mu\\)mol CO2 m-2 s-1. At the daily time resolution, it is reported as g C m-2 day-1. Negative values correspond to an ecosystem absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere, positive values correspond to an ecosystem emitting CO2 to the atmosphere.\nMotivation\nNEE quantifies the net exchange of CO2 between the ecosystem and the atmosphere over a daily time period. Making daily predictions will allow us to rapidly assess skill and provide information in a timeframe pertinent to inform and implement natural resource management.\n\n\nLatent heat flux\nDefinition\nLatent heat flux is the movement of water as water vapor from the ecosystem to the atmosphere. It is reported as W m-2 (equivalent to J m-2 s-1). At the daily time resolution, it is reported as mean W m-2. Positive values correspond to a transfer of water vapor from the ecosystem to the atmosphere.\nMotivation\nLatent heat measures the water loss from an ecosystem to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration (transpiration through plants + evaporation from surfaces).\nForecasting latent heat (evapotranspiration) can provide insights into water stress for plants and the efficiency that plants use water relative to NEE, and to the amount of liquid water remaining in the soil for soil moisture forecasting\n\n\nFocal sites\nInformation on the sites can be found here:\n\nsite_data &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eco4cast/tern4cast/main/tern_field_site_metadata.csv\") |&gt; \n  dplyr::filter(!is.na(data_url))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsite\nsite_id\nfluxnet_id\nlatitude\nlongitude\nelevation\nmat\nmap\nworld_ecoregion\ndata_url\n\n\n\n\nBoyagin\nABOY\nAU-Boy\n-32.4771\n116.9386\n484\nNA\nNA\nNA\nhttps://dap.ozflux.org.au/thredds/dodsC/ozflux/sites/Boyagin/L3/neon_efi/Boyagin_L3_EFI.nc\n\n\nCalperum\nACPR\nAU-Cpr\n-34.0027\n140.5877\n60\n17.9\n301\nMediterranean woodlands\nhttps://dap.ozflux.org.au/thredds/dodsC/ozflux/sites/Calperum/L3/neon_efi/Calperum_L3_EFI.nc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget data calculation\nTo create the data for evaluation (and training) for NEE and LE we extract NEE and LE that pass the turbulence quality control flags provided by TERN and has flux values between -50 and 50 umol CO2 m-2 s-1.\nTo evaluate daily flux forecasts, we select only days with at least 24 of 48 half hours that pass the quality control flags.

It is important to follow these format guidelines in order for your submitted forecasts to pass a set of internal checks that allow the forecast to be visualized and scored correctly.\n\nSteps to submitting\nWe provide an overview of the steps for submitting with the details below:\n\nSubmit registration and model overview for the model using a web form. \nGenerate forecast with required columns. There are three options for the file format described below.\n\nWrite the forecast to a file that follows the standardized naming format.\n\nSubmit forecast (preferably using the submission function that we provide)/\n\n\n\nStep 1: Forecast file format\nThe file is a csv format with the following columns:\n\ndatetime: forecast timestamp. Format %Y-%m-%d.\n\nreference_datetime: The start of the forecast; this should be 0 times steps in the future. This should only be one value of reference_datetime in the file. Format is %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S for terrestrial_30min theme and %Y-%m-%d for all other themes.\nsite_id: NEON code for site\nfamily name of the probability distribution that is described by the parameter values in the parameter column; only normal or ensemble are currently allowed.\nparameter required to be the string mu or sigma (see note below about parameter column) or the number of the ensemble member.\nvariable: standardized variable name for the theme\nprediction: forecasted value for the parameter in the parameter column\nmodel_id: the short name of the model defined as the model_id in the file name (see below) and in your metadata. The model_id should have no spaces.\n\nThe time unit (i.e., date or date-time) should correspond to the time unit of the theme-specific target file (see Theme description). All datetimes with time zones should use UTC as the time zone.\nFor a parametric forecast, the family column uses the word normal to designate a normal distribution and the parameter column must have values of mu and sigma for each forecasted variable, site_id, and time.\nIf you are submitting a forecast that does not have a normal distribution we recommend using the ensemble format and sampling from your non-normal distribution to generate a set of ensemble members that represents your distribution.\nWe aim to support more distributions beyond the normal in the distribution format file (e.g., log-normal distribution to support zero-bounded forecast submissions). Please check back at this site for updates on the list of supported distributions.\nHere is an example of a forecast that uses a normal distribution:\n\nreadr::read_csv(\"https://data.ecoforecast.org/neon4cast-forecasts/raw/aquatics/aquatics-2022-11-07-climatology.csv.gz\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n# A tibble: 68 × 8\n   datetime   variable    parameter family model_id   reference_datetime site_id\n   &lt;date&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;date&gt;             &lt;chr&gt;  \n 1 2022-11-07 temperature mu        normal GLEON_phy… 2022-11-07         BARC   \n 2 2022-11-07 temperature sigma     normal GLEON_phy… 2022-11-07         BARC   \n 3 2022-11-08 temperature mu        normal GLEON_phy… 2022-11-07         BARC   \n 4 2022-11-08 temperature sigma     normal GLEON_phy… 2022-11-07         BARC   \n 5 2022-11-09 temperature mu        normal GLEON_phy… 2022-11-07         BARC   \n 6 2022-11-09 temperature sigma     normal GLEON_phy… 2022-11-07         BARC   \n 7 2022-11-10 temperature mu        normal GLEON_phy… 2022-11-07         BARC   \n 8 2022-11-10 temperature sigma     normal GLEON_phy… 2022-11-07         BARC   \n 9 2022-11-11 temperature mu        normal GLEON_phy… 2022-11-07         BARC   \n10 2022-11-11 temperature sigma     normal GLEON_phy… 2022-11-07         BARC   \n# ℹ 58 more rows\n# ℹ 1 more variable: prediction &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nFor an ensemble (or sample) forecast, the family column uses the word ensemble to design that it is a ensemble forecast and the parameter column is the ensemble member number (1, 2, 3 …)\n\nreadr::read_csv(\"https://data.ecoforecast.org/neon4cast-forecasts/raw/aquatics/aquatics-2022-11-07-persistenceRW.csv.gz\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n# A tibble: 523,600 × 8\n   model_id      datetime   reference_datetime site_id family parameter variable\n   &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;date&gt;     &lt;date&gt;             &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   \n 1 persistenceRW 2022-11-08 2022-11-07         BARC    ensem…         1 chla    \n 2 persistenceRW 2022-11-09 2022-11-07         BARC    ensem…         1 chla    \n 3 persistenceRW 2022-11-10 2022-11-07         BARC    ensem…         1 chla    \n 4 persistenceRW 2022-11-11 2022-11-07         BARC    ensem…         1 chla    \n 5 persistenceRW 2022-11-12 2022-11-07         BARC    ensem…         1 chla    \n 6 persistenceRW 2022-11-13 2022-11-07         BARC    ensem…         1 chla    \n 7 persistenceRW 2022-11-14 2022-11-07         BARC    ensem…         1 chla    \n 8 persistenceRW 2022-11-15 2022-11-07         BARC    ensem…         1 chla    \n 9 persistenceRW 2022-11-16 2022-11-07         BARC    ensem…         1 chla    \n10 persistenceRW 2022-11-17 2022-11-07         BARC    ensem…         1 chla    \n# ℹ 523,590 more rows\n# ℹ 1 more variable: prediction &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Submission process\nIndividual forecast files can be uploaded any time.\nThe correct file name and format is critical for the automated processing of submissions\nTeams can submit their forecast csv files through an R function.\nWe have developed a function called submit() that is available in this GitHub repo\n\nlibrary(aws.s3)\nsource(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eco4cast/tern4cast/main/R/submit.R\")\nforecast_file = \"theme_name-forecast-year-month-day-model_id.csv\"\n\nsubmit(forecast_file = forecast_file,\n                  metadata = NULL,\n                 ask = FALSE)\n\nAlternatively, if you using another programming language, you can submit using AWS S3-like tools (i.e., aws.s3 R package) to the tern4cast-submissions bucket at the data.ecoforecast.org endpoint.\nSubmissions need to adhere to the forecast format that is provided above, including the file naming convention.
