    "text": "Overview\nThe exchange of water and carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and the land is akin to earth’s terrestrial ecosystems breathing rate and lung capacity. One of the best ways to monitor changes in the amount of carbon and water in an ecosystem is the eddy-covariance method. This method observes the net amount of carbon and water entering and exiting ecosystems at half-hourly timesteps, which is important because it can provide information on ecosystem processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, and transpiration, their sensitivities to ongoing climate and land use change, and greenhouse gas budgets for carbon accounting and natural climate solutions. Forecasts of carbon uptake and release along with water use can provide insights into future production of food, fiber, timber, and carbon credits. Additionally, forecasts will highlight the influence that stress and disturbance have on carbon and water cycling."

Forecasts daily time step over the next 30-days. Weather forecasts from NOAA Global Ensemble Forecast System are provided to use as model drivers (if forecasting model uses meteorological inputs). Forecasts can be submitted daily\nTeams are asked to submit their forecast of measured NEON NEE and LE, along with uncertainty estimates and metadata. Any existing NEE and LE may be used to build and improve the models used to generate forecasts. Other data can be used so long as they are not from the month being forecast and the data are made publicly available (minimum of URL, but ideally a script) and accessible to all teams in the challenge."

    "text": "Data: Targets\nThe challenge uses the following TERN data products:\nINSERT\nA file with previously released TERN data that has been processed into “targets” is provided below. The same processing will be applied to new data that are used for forecast evaluation. ### Net ecosystem exchange\nDefinition\nNet ecosystem exchange (NEE) is the net movement of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to the ecosystem. At the 30-minute time resolution it is reported as \\(\\mu\\)mol CO2 m-2 s-1. At the daily time resolution it is reported as g C m-2 day-1. Negative values correspond to an ecosystem absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere, positive values correspond to an ecosystem emitting CO2 to the atmosphere.\nMotivation\nNEE quantifies the net exchange of CO2 between the ecosystem and the atmosphere over that 30-minute or daily time period. Assessing skill at predicting 1/2 hourly - sub daily measurements provides more insight into ability to capture diel processes. The diel curve contains information on how plants and soil immediately respond to variations in meteorology.\nMaking daily predictions will allow us to rapidly assess skill and provide information in a timeframe pertinent to inform and implement natural resource management. It also allows for models that do not produce sub-daily estimates to participate\n\nLatent heat flux\nDefinition\nLatent heat flux is the movement of water as water vapor from the ecosystem to the atmosphere. It is reported as W m-2 (equivalent to J m-2 s-1). At the daily time resolution it is reported as mean W m-2. Positive values correspond to a transfer of water vapor from the ecosystem to the atmosphere.\nMotivation\nLatent heat measures the water loss from an ecosystem to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration (transpiration through plants + evaporation from surfaces).\nForecasting latent heat (evapotranspiration) can provide insights to water stress for plants and the efficiency that plants are using water relative to NEE, and to the amount of liquid water remaining in the soil for soil moisture forecasting\n\n\nFocal sites\nInformation on the sites can be found here:\n\nsite_data <- readr::read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eco4cast/tern4cast/main/tern_field_site_metadata.csv\") |> \n  dplyr::filter(!is.na(data_url))\n\n\n\ntarget data calculation\nTo create the data for evaluation (and training) for NEE and LE we extract NEE and LE that pass the turbulence quality control flags (qfqm.fluxCo2.turb.qfFinl = 0 ) provided by NEON and has flux values between -50 and 50 umol CO2 m-2 s-1.\nThe table with the half-hour NEE and LE has the following columns\n\ndatetime: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM for the start of the 30-minute period in UTC\n\nsite_id: NEON site code (e.g., BART)\n\nvariable: nee (umol CO2 m-2 s-1) or le W m-2\n\nobserved: value for variable\n\nTo evaluate daily flux forecasts, we select only days with at least 24 of 48 half hours that pass the quality control flags. For these days, we average the half-hours and convert carbon to daily units (gC/m2/day). The daily data table has the following columns.\n\ndatetime: YYYY-MM-DD (the day is determined using UTC time)\n\nsite_id: NEON site code (e.g., BART)\n\nvariable: nee (g C m-2 day-1) or le (W m-2)\nobservation: value for variable\n\nHere is the download link and format of the terrestrial_daily target file\n\nreadr::read_csv(\"https://data.ecoforecast.org/tern4cast-targets/terrestrial_daily/terrestrial_daily-targets.csv.gz\", guess_max = 1e6) |> \n  na.omit()\n\n# A tibble: 20,561 × 4\n   datetime   site_id variable observation\n   <date>     <chr>   <chr>          <dbl>\n 1 2010-07-30 ACPR    le            48.8  \n 2 2010-07-31 ACPR    le            22.6  \n 3 2010-07-31 ACPR    nee           -0.296\n 4 2010-08-01 ACPR    le            69.6  \n 5 2010-08-01 ACPR    nee           -1.27 \n 6 2010-08-02 ACPR    le            21.1  \n 7 2010-08-02 ACPR    nee           -0.375\n 8 2010-08-03 ACPR    le            15.7  \n 9 2010-08-03 ACPR    nee           -0.563\n10 2010-08-04 ACPR    le             9.48 \n# ℹ 20,551 more rows"

The key is that submissions are predictions of the future.\nDaily submissions are allowed and encouraged as new observations and weather forecasts become available, therefore the automation of forecast generation may be ideal. There are many ways to automate scripts that are written to download observations and metreology drivers, generate forecasts, and submit forecasts. Two tools that many have used are cron jobs (see the R package cronR) that execute tasks at user specifics times and github actions.\nCron jobs work on unix and mac systems. An example of a script that executes a cron job using R can be found here."
